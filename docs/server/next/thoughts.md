# Thoughts on Next.js

## Purpose

It seems to be a web framework intended for sever-side rendering of react components.

## Data Fetching

Data can be fetched client-side by using the api at pages/api.

## Benefits

The good side that I can see from this is for static site generation. It would be easy to create a static site from data on a database and deploy to production on S3 or something.
