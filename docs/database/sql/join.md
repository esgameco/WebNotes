# SQL Table Joins

> Join Two Tables
```sql
SELECT * FROM {table1}, {table2} WHERE {qualifier};
-- Qualifier is used to compare whether a column in one table is the same or different than a column in another table
-- Such as: username = user
-- Where username and user should have the same value on both tables
